# Gomoku in PHP, HTML5, Javascript, and CSS3

## Gomoku introduction
Gomoku, also called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is traditionally played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a 13x13 Go board while in the past a 19Ã—19 board was standard.
Because pieces are typically not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a paper-and-pencil game. The game is known in several countries under different names.
